## About The Linux From Scratch Project
Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that allows you to create your own Linux Distribution. Most modern Operating Systems come with pre-compiled packages that make it function properly. Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu all follow this strategy. The idea is that after you install the OS, it works right away. The user does not have to worry about efficiency or customization, as long as "it just works." This model is known as The Point Release Development Model. It comes at the advantage of convenience and having a stable system intended for the average user. But this model also comes at the cost of freedom, speed, and not having the latest software. In the Rolling Release Model, you have the freedom to choose software that fits your preference. When you build an OS from scratch, you install only the software you want. This makes the system a lot faster because it doesn't have to devote RAM and Storage to an application you can't uninstall. The last issue with the Point Release Development Model is that packages are not released until the latest version of the OS is updated, on average this takes about six months for the package to reach the user. In the Rolling Release Model you get the package as soon as the new version is released. This is useful because the user doesn't have to wait on the OS for a package update.            

## Why Linux From Scratch?  

I have had such a great experience using Arch Linux and want to go beyond a minimalist Linux distribution. Arch and LFS are both rolling release but differ from the fact that in LFS you have to build the packages from source. Arch uses a package manager, so you either download the package from the Official Arch Repository using the `pacman -S [name of package]` command or from the Arch User Repository (AUR) using the `yaourt [name of package]` command. Building a package from source requires the user to manually download the package and configure it to work on the system. This takes A LOT more work. LFS is the next step towards a deeper level of understanding of Linux. By building this Operating System from scratch, the developer will get a better sense of the internal workings of Linux. If you love Linux, this is definitively a good project to be a part of. This project should take a couple weeks to complete the first version.
